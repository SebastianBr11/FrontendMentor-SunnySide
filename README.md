## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

After I already started with the site, I came across the [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) course by Kevin Powell, where I learned a whole lot about mobile first layouts and responsive layouts in general. As i had already started with this project, I decided not to redo it, but instead fix any issues and finish the site with the new knowledge of the course as well as other videos by [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kevinpowell).

Other stuff to mention:

- [Responsive images with the picture element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)
